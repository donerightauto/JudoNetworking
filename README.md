JudoNetworking
=============
JudoNetworking simplifies communication with servers which cooperates with mobile devices based on Android platform.
There are many cases where mobile applications fetch data from servers using JSON-RPC or REST protocols.
Usually it takes some unnecessary effort to achieve proper communication layer with servers.
JudoNetworking introduces abstraction in way of describing API interface in mobile endpoint.
This abstraction is similar to Microsoft WCF solution.
